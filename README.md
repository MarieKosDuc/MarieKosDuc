 Hi, Iâ€™m Marie Koscianski-Ducharlet, full-stack software engineer, specializing in Java/Spring Boot and Angular!
 
I used to be as an event-reporter for work councils, a fascinating non-routine job that led me to work for drastically diverse companies and organizations in aeronautics, retail, the automotive industry... I attended more than 1500 professional meetings during this first professional life. But after 11 years listening to others' projects, I felt the need for change and decided to engage in professional retraining to become a software engineer with [Ada Tech School - ths school that beaks codes and conventions !](https://adatechschool.fr/ )

- Why software engineering?
      I am at heart a problem solver and I love learning. In my previous job, I had to understand very quickly the obvious and not-so-obvious social, economic and often technological challenges the companies I worked for faced. Imagine skimming in one week for airplanes to yoghurts to pharmaceuticals to automobiles to retail! I am fascinated by the diversity of challenges the IT faces in different companies, and I want to be at the heart of it.
      
- Why Ada Tech School?
      I didn't want to enroll in a bootcamp, code 24/7 for a few weeks until I hated code and then be left to myself to fend for my first job in tech. Instead, I chose an 'alternative' school that promotes diversity in tech, specializes in professional retraining for women, has a Montessori approach to learning, and accompanies its student with a 9-month initial training followed by a one-year apprenticeship



ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything new in tech! I love learning and discovering new ways to respond to today and tomorrow's challenges.
